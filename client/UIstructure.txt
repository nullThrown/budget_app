COMPONENT STRUCTURE
  profile/
    incomeCard.js
    expenditures.js

  forms/
    loginForm.js
    signupForm.js

  landing/
  

  CSS STRUCTURE
    global styles for generic classes
      typography, animations, variables

    each component will then have its own css local file for specific styles

    refactoring should be done after UI is complete to find patterns and move styles from local -> global
