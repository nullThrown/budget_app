component structure will be modeled after routes

COMPONENT STRUCTURE
  profile/
    incomeCard.js
    expenditures.js

  forms/
    loginForm.js
    signupForm.js

  landing/
  

  CSS STRUCTURE
    global styles for generic classes
      typography, animations, variables

    each component will then have its own css local file for specific styles

    refactoring should be done after UI is complete to find patterns and move styles from local -> global 

    todo list 
    *Landing Page
      * fix weird border issue on 'how it works' section 
      * create keyframe 'moveright' -> from {opactity: 0, translateX(-10)} to {opacity: 1, translateX(0)}
      * create keyframe 'moveleft' -> from {opactity: 0, translateX(10)} to {opacity: 1, translateX(0)}
      * change background color
      *structure 
        *header
        *description -- another component that gives a clearer picture of what the app does
        *img/descr -- more description about specific elements of the app -- think of them as hooks(writing not react)
        *another signup/login section
    *Home
      note: css sheets added to indiv. components appear to be placed globally... CSS modules should hopefully fix the problem
