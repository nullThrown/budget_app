component structure will be modeled after routes

COMPONENT STRUCTURE
  profile/
    incomeCard.js
    expenditures.js
      *create min-width for container 
      *add horizontal scroll 
      *perhaps change color for add expenditure button
      *change header-desc section -- looks fairly ugly
        *add bg-color to certain info -- perhaps the spent $ of $ part
  forms/
    loginForm.js
    signupForm.js
      use reducer for password validation checks. useReducer is more suited for when a single action updates multiple 

  landing/
  

  CSS STRUCTURE
    global styles for generic classes
      typography, animations, variables

    each component will then have its own css local file for specific styles

    refactoring should be done after UI is complete to find patterns and move styles from local -> global
