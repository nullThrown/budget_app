CSS STRUCTURE

TODO LIST 1-3-22

  REDUX
  auth
    *login user
      Should logging in a user require redux?
      if no state is being updated
  entire home page should be linked up to redux store -- dummy data for now, eventual integration of express API data
  *restructure models
        
    *useSelector for overview component
    
    *useSelector for budget component
      *will need to use similar technique of combining two separate selections

    *watch traversy video on MERN stack

UI TODO LIST

  global
    *create footer component
    *fix header hierarchy

  /landing

    header
        *Fix header spacing issue
        *center main content
        *fix height to accomodate Intro 'How does coin drop work?' text
        *find background color or img that looks nice
        *change title 'Coin Drop' different font/size etc.
      *mess around with the color gradient -- make it look cool or whatever

    Intro 
      *Add video into colored div taken from the home page 
      *rewrite intro paragraph -- current one is very poor
      *find a cool background color- see how it looks
        *para should provide a succinct but thorough description of the app
        *user should have a strong understanding of what the app actually does
    
    Description
      *add image to green div
      *add background color or image 
      *perhaps increase img size -- deal with that once we have images in place
    
    Footer
      *add background color or image 
      

  profile
      general 
        layout
        sizing
          *add rem sizing to all text
            *add % to html tag for rem sizing
            *set breakpoint to downsize all text

          *fix overflow issues upon smallest size  
          *fix any other issues with sizing upon smaller viewport
          
      *exp 
        *allow horizontal scroll to expenditures component
    
      *nav
       *toggle nav visibility/placement upon button press
         *nav menu links need to be set to visibility:none in order to be removed from 
         the focus selection list -- accessibility issue. more research needed.



    /home
      global 
        *add container to content that creates even spacing between title and rest of content
        *mess around with heading class -- smaller could work better
        *normalize colors -- greens and reds should be the same color -- base colors should be taken from expenditures span items
        *rename components to appropriate names

      nav

      dashboard

      banner

      budget
        *display nec. spent, ind. spent, and remaining as numbers
          *add amounts to legend items
        *figure out color scheme for graph

      recurring
        *add pagination
          *limit number of categories rendered per page

  REDUX STATE

  todo
    *create auth slice
      *create dispatch action for register user 
      *create dispatch action for login user
      *create dispatch action for logout user
      

  general
    Eventual integration of redux toolkit
    perhaps different tools like redux-query...
    find the simplest manner of maintaining state
  budget
    *need to combine state from both expenditures and profile.recurringPayments
    *both arrays are pulled from redux store
    *need to add some sort of business logic that combines the results of these two return state values
      *react strict mode causes this function to run twice thereby adding the elements twice
      *this is clearly the wrong solution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXPRESS API 

  models
    profile
      *recurringPayments should be renamed categorySpending
        *whenever a new category is created -- it will be added to categorySpending array
        *payments subdoc of recurringPayments should be renamed recurring payments
