## Budget App

##Beta version 2.0

note: expect rapid changes to application within the coming weeks.

An application meant to allow simple tracking of income and expenses. The layout is simple, it shows the user income after taxes and subtracts expenses. Users can add expenses as they make purchases or add recurring monthly expenses. Every expense is placed inside of a category (housing, utilites, miscellaneous etc.) and tracked separately. 

  There is both monthly and yearly tracking. It is possible to see how your grocery bill, for instance, has changed from month to month or year to year. 

    All data is presented not only numerically but also in easy-to-read graphs.


    ## Potentional Features 

    Along with the home and yearly pages, a plan page will hopefully be added as well. The plan page allows the user to set financial goals for the future. A financial goal may include hitting a specific amount within a certain category (groceries). The user will be prompted when the current amount is moving closer to goal.
